- 👋 Hi, I’m @The1337Racer
- 👀 I’m exceptionally intrested in cars particulary from a young age
- with my favourite car brand being ford espescially around the 90s with Mcrae. 
- I'm exceedingly interested in technology from having games consoles to computers
- to a car sim racing set which I have spent a good amount of time understanding and learning.
- Finally, my last main interest is sports with a wide range of knowledge on
- multiple sports such as rugby which i played for a few years,cricket which I
- currently still play every summer and darts which I have done well in and spend time
- playing and watching it with my step dad who is a semi professional.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve myself not just physically but also mentally
- with going to the gym it has helped me to learn that taking time away from things
- can help you be more mentally prepared for challenges that come along.
- I would like to learn more about drones since I believe it will be a main stay
- in technology with it's multiple uses from defense to delivery to even helping out
- in lower developed countries. I would like to learn more on the linux and security
- side of coding since it would be useful for future jobs which can open up in the
- defense sector due to the wide scale amount of wars happening in the world.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning to code again through multiple languages
- from python,C# and java which I have a good understanding of but would like to get
- back into learning more of these codes for future projects or for a new job
- 📫 You can reach me on my linkedin profile
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have played in multiple professional sports stadiums such as the
- ulster rugby stadium and the ireland cricket stadium.
