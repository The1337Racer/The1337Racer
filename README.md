- 👋 Hi, I’m @The1337Racer
- 👀 I’m interested in Cars that have been modified, raced or tuned for drifting.
- Highly interested in gaming with games such as gran turismo and dirt rally.
- Finally, my last main interest is sports with a wide range of knowledge on
- multiple sports such as football,cricket and darts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to improve myself not just physically but also mentally
- with going to the gym it has helped me to learn that taking time away from things
- can help you be more mentally prepared for challenges that come along.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning to code again through multiple languages
- from python,C# and java which I have a good understanding of but would like to get
- back into learning more of these codes for future projects or for a new job
- 📫 You can reach me on my linkedin profile
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have played in multiple professional sports stadiums such as the
- ulster rugby stadium and the ireland cricket stadium.
